## Ethical Considerations of Web Scraping for this project  
Web scraping provides valuable data collection techniques but must be handled responsibly. This document outlines the ethical considerations and practices followed in this project to ensure that data collection from ArtNet is done in a respectful and lawful manner.

## Purpose of Data Collection 

The data for this project is collected from the ArtNet website, specifically focusing on auction listings for artworks. The primary purpose of this data collection is to provide a practical example of web scraping. It aims to help users gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of what web scraping is, while keeping the learning environment ethical.

## Best Practices for Ethical Data Collection 

1. **Respect for robots.txt File**  
We adhere to ArtNet’s robots.txt file, which outlines sections of the site that are disallowed for scraping, such as URLs containing /admin, /services, and other restricted areas. We make sure that only publicly available data from permissible sections of the site are accessed. The robots.txt file disallows scraping by certain user agents, which we respect.

2. **Rate Limiting**  
To minimize our impact on ArtNet's servers and avoid disruption to the website's normal operation, the project implements a randomized rate limit of 1-6 seconds between requests. This ensures a lower risk of overloading the server and avoids aggressive scraping techniques.

3. **Privacy Policy Compliance**  
This project only collects publicly available data related to artwork auctions. We do not collect any personal or private information from users of the ArtNet website. Additionally, there is no attempt to bypass password protection or other security measures put in place by the website.

## Data Usage 

The data collected in this project is used for educational purposes only. It is intended to demonstrate ethical web scraping practices and analyze auction data to explore bidding recommendations. All sensitive data, if stored, must be excluded from version control (e.g., added to `.gitignore`) to ensure the security and privacy of any personal information.

## Note 

All users are expected to respect the website’s policies and adhere to the ethical guidelines outlined above while running this project. Following these best practices ensures ethical data collection and helps protect the integrity of the ArtNet platform.
